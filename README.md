# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

    My motivation was to create a database that you can always create new products to add and store, and even call back and recieve your information in a json format. I wanted to see that i had the ability to make each and every one of these functions work and it turns out I have and hopefully I can apply this in a real life setting.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

    I built this project, like the rest of them to test my knowledge, each request on the back end is very similar and this project taught me a lot about all of these requests. It taught me various things about seeding databases and I can really see the uses of this in a real life scenario.

- What problem does it solve?

    This solves the issue of putting information in a database and creating ways store and make information for a website. It can be used in various ways such as making lists or even a social media website.

- What did you learn?

    I learned how to use Insomnia further than what i already knew and more about get, post, put, and delete requests. I learned more about the back-end and how to link it to get and make information in a json format.
